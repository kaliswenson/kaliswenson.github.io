				<h3>Day 26</h3>
				<h4>05.01.15</h4>
				<p>Happy May Day! Make like these flowers and hop over authority's fences. And/or give someone flowers. It might not better society, but it'll at least brighten that person's day.</p>

				<h3>Day 25</h3>
				<h4>04.30.15</h4>
				<p>Of course, I really want to travel and live in new places, like soon, but there's something special about a city that still excites and surprises after a number of years. I walk under or past this bridge pretty much every day, and I still love the way it looks--especially in the sun.</p>

				<h3>Day 19</h3>
				<h4>04.24.15</h4>
				<p>On the first Wednesday of every month, the Sorrento Hotel (the building on the left) hosts a Silent Reading Party. I've been meaning to go for years, but I've always been in class, at work, too busy, too forgetful, or too late (it fills up fast!). Maybe May will make for my first time sitting down with a group of strangers, a glass of wine, and a good book. P.S. Currently reading The Geography of Bliss because who isn't looking for some of that?</p>

				<h3>Day 9</h3>
				<h4>04.14.15</h4>
				<p>I'm short on film (it's expensive!) because this is what taking a photo per day really looks like. I usually have upwards of seven shots before there's one I'm even mildly happy with. The hardest part of this is that I can't just keep tapping them out like on my iPhone. I'm focusing more on what's in the frame, the exposure, and how I think the film will react. But, of course, I'm still constantly ending up with photos much different than I expected.</p>

				<h3>Day 3</h3>
				<h4>04.08.15</h4>
				<p>Time for a little abstraction. When I prepared my usual tea and oatmeal this morning, I boiled some extra water to make these emulsion lifts. An emulsion lift is the removal and transfer of the emulsion layer of Polaroid film. It disconnects from the rigid square sheet and becomes a sort of jelly, flowing image that can stick to other things. These came from some old developed but unexposed film that otherwise would've been wasted.</p>

				<h3>Day 2</h3>
				<h4>04.07.15</h4>
				<p>Call me selfish, but for the past several months I've been focusing a lot on giving to myself. Whether that's going to bed early instead of staying out with friends or taking a day off work for a treat-yourself day trip, I'm giving in to what I want and learning why I do. I feel clearer in who I am and what I can have. It's easier to find the time and energy for the big things when you gift yourself the little things instead of stressing about them all.</p>

				<h3>Day 1</h3>
				<h4>04.06.15</h4>
				<p>Though it has been a couple of months since I moved into a new house, a lot of it stills feels mysterious to me. There are nooks, like this damp passageway, I've yet to explore and creaks that still creep me out when heard home alone at night. It's an ongoing process turning a house into a home, one that means accepting the structure's character before trying to meld it with your own.</p>
